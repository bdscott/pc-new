Punchcard places highly qualified tech professionals in classrooms across the country, where they teach engaging courses in software design and computer programming.

Because our instructors are practitioners, course content evolves in step with the movements of the industry.  Students leave the program prepared to join the most exciting and cutting-edge teams in tech.

Here are a few of our guiding beliefs:

## Students should learn by doing

Students get their hands dirty on day one of each class, writing real code.

## We should teach what&rsquo;s relevant

We introduce languages and frameworks used by companies doing meaningful work. Students can leave our program and secure jobs and internships with the skills they've acquired.

## Instructors should be mentors

Our instructors are world-class developers and designers who can provide invaluable guidance to students entering the industry. Small classes (capped at 15) allow instructors to develop a strong relationship with each student.
