We go to great lengths to ensure that our instructors are the best possible fit for your students and the course. Each is a master of his or her craft and has a desire to share that craft with the next generation of creative problem-solvers.

To verify that our standards of exceptional instruction are being met, our Instruction Lead will visit several times over the course of the semester. Plans to visit will be made at least 24 hours in advance to allow for appropriate credentialing.

In addition to these &ldquo;drop-in&rdquo; visits, the Instruction Lead will schedule two joint observations with a school administrator once the course has been booked. Constructive notes help first-time instructors develop in their role.
