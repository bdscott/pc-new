## What's included

Your payment to Punchcard Labs covers the instructor's fee, the use of fully-configured Google Chromebooks, and any software or printed materials that the instructor selects. This amount is charged per student (see *Tuition*), and there are no hidden fees.

## Deposit

A deposit of $4,350 is required for each course you plan to offer in a given semester. This allows us to invest in hiring a great instructor in your area and ensures that the required hardware and software are ready for the first day of class.

**The deposit is due 30 calendar days before classes begin.**

## Tuition

Tuition for the fall 2015 semester is $435 per student enrollment. Your deposit is applied directly to the total amount of tuition for a class.

**The difference between the deposit and the total amount of tuition is due 7 calendar days before classes begin. No part of the deposit is refundable.**
