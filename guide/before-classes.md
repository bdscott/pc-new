## Prepare the classroom

Our instructors need access to a room with a projector that can be connected to a laptop. It should comfortably accomodate 15 students, but needn't be a computer lab. Each student will be issued a Google Chromebook for use in the class. 

The room will need strong wifi connectivity. Your IT department should be able to identify areas in the building that would be better.

## Conduct background checks

We will provide you with the information necessary to conduct an instructor screening before the semester begins. If you would like, information can also be provided for Punchcard executives who will be conducting on-site instructor reviews during the semester.

## Provide building access

Your instructor will need easy access to the building. Consider issuing a faculty ID or adding him or her to a &ldquo;frequent guest&rdquo; list to expedite check-in. We also suggest introducing the instructor to front office and security personnel.

Our Instruction Lead will need occasional visitor access to the building to review class performance. Plans to visit will be made at least 24 hours in advance to allow for appropriate credentialing.

## Introduce us to your tech team

We will require some help from your IT team in the weeks before classes begin. Our two primary needs will be:

* Adding student Chromebooks to your school's wireless network
* Whitelisting domains and ports that will be necessary for the completion of coursework
* Creating an instructor account in your online gradebook (if you use one)
