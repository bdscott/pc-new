Computer Science graduates are some of the most highly paid in the country, yet only 2% of all college students choose to study computing. This has resulted in more than 600,000 unfilled jobs not just in Silicon Valley, but within organizations across the country.

While a handful of high schools offer technology courses of *some* kind, most don't have the resources to develop a quality coding curriculum. We think students deserve more from their STEM education than a class in word processing, so we're here to help.

Punchcard places highly qualified tech professionals in classrooms across the country, where they teach engaging courses in software design and computer programming.

Because our instructors are practitioners, our course content evolves in step with the movements of the industry.  Students leave the program prepared to join the most exciting and cutting-edge teams in tech.
