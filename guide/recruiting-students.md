Punchcard courses are designed to be accessible to all students, regardless of previous experience with technology. In fact, we only hire instructors who have taught beginners in the past. Hosting a Code.org <a href="http://hourofcode.com/us" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a> event is a great way to recruit students who might not consider themselves &ldquo;techy.&rdquo;

Classes are capped at 15 students, which allows instructors to spend time with students individually as needed. We encourage schools to recruit as full a class as possible, as it improves our ability to assign team projects later in the semester.

<p class="message">Below, we have included course descriptions and objectives for each of the courses we offer. You are free to reproduce this information in your own course catalogue and recruitment materials.</p>
