Computer Science graduates are some of the most highly paid in the country, yet only 2% of all college students choose to study computing. This has resulted in more than 600,000 unfilled jobs not just in Silicon Valley, but within organizations across the country.

While a handful of high schools offer technology courses of some kind, most don't have the resources to develop a quality coding curriculum. We think students deserve more from their STEM education than a class in word processing, so we're here to help.

We want to place highly qualified tech professionals in classrooms across the country, where they will teach the fundamentals of design and computer programming. We believe that students should be taught not just to use the technology of the moment, but how to craft creative solutions to the problems of the future.

Our classes are small (we cap at 15), and students learn by working on real projects. Our pricing is simple, with no hidden costs. $435 per student includes the instructor, the curriculum, and a Google Chromebook with all of the software they'll need.
